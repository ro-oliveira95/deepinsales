### Introduction
Web app made in my free time to both test and improve my skills, and also to help friends to be more sucessfull while selling products on a brazilian marketplace.\
The goal of the app is to keep track of sells and views of any ad page saved by the user. The current version of the app only accepts ads from Mercado Livre, but could be expanded in the future.\

### Version review
This is a version 2 of the app. Version 1 was implemented without a frontend framework and had a poor backend architecture.
The current version uses Node.js + Express on the backend, and Reac[t in the frontend. Future plans includes changuing the backend to Python (Flask or FastAPI) to extend data manipulation (and because I love Python :D).
